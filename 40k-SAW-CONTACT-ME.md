Hello there!

Forgive my odd way of communicating with you; this is the only way I could sort out a contact method.

My name's Steve and I came across your repository for Ordoor last night. I have been working on a similar
project on and off for about as long as you have, except from the Soldiers at War perspective. I've only
recently had any real success; a combination of decompiling binaries, some help from the AI, and generally
just slogging it out a lot harder than I have in the past.

If only I saw your repo earlier, it would have saved me quite a bit of time -- however at this point I
am in a similar position insofar as decyphering the files to start actually building the game.

In particular I'm in the middle of figuring out the map. I'm about where you are, at least in terms of
your documentation, in understanding the SAW map.

Anyway, why am I reaching out to you? I'm not entirely sure :) You seem like perhaps a kindred spirit
in a project like this, perhaps someone I can bounce ideas off of and perhaps keep us both motivated
to move forward with our efforts. Like you, I had the idea of course of supporting the other games that
use the same engine, though I've never played any of them and it's not really my 'passion'. My 'passion'
here is to build a game engine upon which I could then build my own game. There is a lot I like about
Soldiers at War, and things that captivated me as a kid on into adulthood.

I suppose a world where I'm building things left/right center and floor seems approachable and 'doable'.
I like the multi-level worlds; they're 3D but easy to build. The destroyable environments are cool, too,
you can destroy pretty much everything in SAW and often to gameplay benefit. Can't find the key? Blow
up the wall! A lot of modern games do this, but SAW was one of the first games I've seen that really
invited the player to find multiple solutions to a problem.

One of my favorite solutions was to play the missions with a single guy; if he survives about 4 or
5 missions he becomes an Elder God can start killing people with his mind. Seriously, on the last
mission, I can just have him sit in his starting position and opportunity-fire clear most of the
board in a single turn :D

Anyway ... this isn't supposed to be a love letter to SAW, just perhaps an opportunity to connect
with a like-minded fellow. I've managed to actually talk to several of the SAW developers and pump
their brains over the years; sadly they don't remember much, though oddly enough they developed the
game about a 25 minute drive from where I lived while they were developing it :) My first job took
me past their building on a regular basis, and I never knew at the time!

If you are interested in communicating with me further, just mention in the PR chat and I will
provide email contact. I'm not doing so in this letter because I'd rather not have my email out
there for eternity in github's history, and I have no idea if you would even like to talk to me
or not so feel free to just ignore this and I won't bother you further.

Thanks so much for your time in reading my rambles, hope you have a good 2026.

- Steve
